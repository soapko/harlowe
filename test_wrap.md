# Test Soft Wrapping

This is a short line.

This is a much longer line that should wrap when displayed in the markdown viewer. It contains enough text to exceed the typical terminal width, allowing us to test the soft wrapping functionality that we just implemented in the MarkdownViewer widget.

Another short line.

## Section 2

Here's another really long paragraph with lots of text that will definitely need to wrap. The purpose of this is to verify that the text wrapping implementation works correctly across multiple lines and different sections of the document. We want to make sure that line numbers are displayed correctly, that selection still works properly with wrapped lines, and that navigation behaves as expected.

Short.

This line is intentionally very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very long to test wrapping.
