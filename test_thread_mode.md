# Test Thread Mode

This is a test file for the new thread mode feature.

## Section 1

Here is some content that we can create threads on. This line has enough text to potentially wrap when displayed in the terminal, which will help us test the soft-wrapping behavior.

## Section 2

More content here. Let's add a few lines to have something to work with:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

## Section 3

Final section with some more text to create threads on.
