## Notes

- The feature uses Textual's Screen system for modal dialogs
- Resource files are saved in `.md-editor-resources.json` in the same directory as the markdown files
- This file should be added to `.gitignore` if desired (local preference)
- Resource files are included in Claude prompts via the existing `resource_files` mechanism in ClaudeThreadManager
